# generateEoM
This file is a code in matlab to generate equations of motion of an articulated system.

Note:
1) Takes rigid body assumption
2) Articulated rigid body could consist of either cylinder, capsule or cuboids
3) The joints between the rigid bodies could be revolute, prismatic or spherical.
4) The code generates analytical equations of motion using symbolic toolbox.
